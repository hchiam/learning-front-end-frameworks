# My notes for the Udacity course: [Front End Frameworks](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud894)

## Asides

- this course focuses on: complete application frameworks -> afterwards: can pick up React, which only really handles the view
- this course builds on courses like these: https://github.com/hchiam/learning-web-tooling-and-automation and https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js-design-patterns

## Notes

- learn how to use and choose frameworks
