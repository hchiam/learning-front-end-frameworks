# My notes for the Udacity course: [Front End Frameworks](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud894)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-frameworks--ud894

## Asides

- this course focuses on: complete application frameworks -> afterwards: can pick up React, which only really handles the view
- this course builds on courses like these: https://github.com/hchiam/learning-web-tooling-and-automation and https://github.com/hchiam/learning-js-design-patterns
- https://github.com/udacity/FEF-UdaciMeals-Backbone and https://github.com/udacity/FEF-UdaciMeals-Backbone-Server and `cd binaries; ./server_darwin_amd64 --www=../../FEF-UdaciMeals-Backbone` and http://localhost:8000/

## Notes

- learn how to use and choose frameworks
